# Project AtLast

Project AtLast, acronym for for *Another Tool for Learning Analysis and Study Tracking*, is a mobile web application for students to track their study activities and efforts, follow up their progress and derive insight in their study progress through statistics. This project is developed by team CWA1 as part of the P&O3 course of the academic year 2011-2012 at [Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (K.U.Leuven)](http://www.kuleuven.be/).

Our goal is to create a tool which is both useful and fun to use. We want to provide features which genuinely help you study better, such as active study tracking and detailed statistics and graphs. On the other side, we want to encourage students to use our application by making the user interface simple yet effective.
